From discussing this with Brent and AnnMarie, there may some tax issues with 
merging these 2 structures. As best I can articulate this, the merger of 
Timberwolf into Porcupine would be treated as a reissuance of debt by LJM, 
causing them to recognize gain [made all the worse by no associated 
distribution of tax]. The TIA executed in connection with Raptor 3 would 
require indemnififcation by ENE based on LJM's demand in this case, withuot 
the need for the Service to take a position on the issue.

At his staff meeting this morning, Andy raised the possibility of some type 
of "merger" between Raptor 2 and 3 so as to provide support for the hedge on 
TNPC warrants.  My understanding is that Ryan is currently reviewing the 
feasibility of this type of arrangement from an accounting perspective.  I 
wanted to provide you with a heads-up in the event that this takes on some 
urgency in the next few days/weeks.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Jeff:

I'm sure this is just a "misunderstanding", but I know that UBS Capital has spent innumerable hours with management.  While Mark says that he doesn't want LJM to have an advantage, it looks like LJM is being put at a disadvantage.  You would think that Cliff and Mark would welcome a new bidder with open arms after failing to sell this business for 2+ years.  Until this is resolved, I'll assume that LJM is out of the bidding and will not do any further work.  Enron is back to one bidder (the lower one) -- better for our company ???

Jeff,

After your call I thought I should give you some background on Datacentric Broadband (DCB). 

1.	The company was founded by Leslie Anderson a woman entrepreneur in Conroe Texas.  Leslie continues to be the largest non institutional shareholder and is Chairman of the Board.  The president is Gary Remy, a Hispanic, whom you met recently at the YPO gathering. 

2.	DCB is in the broadband wireless access market focusing on smaller cities in Texas.  They have deployed in nine different locations and have a strategy to grow from a regional player to a national player.  The market they are in requires no license fees and is one where being first to locate in a city is critical to success.

3.	We have invested $2 million in DCB to date and brought in Redstone Investors who also invested $2 million. Redstone should continue to participate with us in any future investments we make in DCB.

4.	We have talked to Kevin Garland  to solicit interest from him, however he made it clear that DCB was not in his target market and he was not interested in the investment.

5.	DCB has engaged Arthur Andersen to help raise additional funds for continued growth.  We along with AA have been talking to other potential investors and have found a receptive yet cautious reception.

6.	About two weeks ago we were approached by representatives of Union Pacific Railroad and Norfolk Southern Railroad with a proposal to invest up to $75 million in DCB over the next five years beginning with an initial investment of $15 million.  U P asked if Enron would be willing to invest a similar amount alongside them to help DCB grow into a national broadband wireless access provider to smaller cities. After this request I asked Ken Rice if EBS would be interested in an investment in DCB either in conjunction with U P or on a stand alone basis.  My hope was that EBS would view DCB as a strategic fit to their business model and would be interested in a much closer relationship with DCB perhaps leading to a buyout. ( Although EBS and  DCB are in different businesses I know that the trading group of EBS has used DCB to provide liquidity and last mile access for many of their trades.)  Ken's response was that EBS was not interested in an investment in DCB and he didn't see a strategic fit between the two companies.  

7.	We have also talked to Lou's group, the Xcelerator, and to LJM about investments in DCB and it appears that LJM is very interested in committing funds however I don't think they will be ready in time to match U P's commitment.

8. 	At a subsequent meeting with U P we told them not to expect any additional funds from Enron other that a possible $2 to $3 million from ourselves since that is all of the capacity that we have left for this investment.  They are very disappointed that Enron does not see the strategic potential of this business the way they do, but nevertheless are still moving forward in their efforts to invest in DCB in the $75 million range.  We are currently in the due diligence process with U P and hope to wrap up a deal structure by the end of May.

	 We have solicited the support of other Enron groups all along the way while making our investment decision.  I truly believe that DCB is in a space that could be very integral to the success of EBS and had hoped that we could work together more closely, however EBS does not see a strategic fit with DCB.  We will continue to develop relationships with other strategic and financial partners in order to enhance and grow the value of our investment in DCB.

	I will be happy to talk to you further about DCB and our investment.  We will of course seek your approval for any additional investments that we make in DCB.  Please call me if you have any additional questions.

Gene

To: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECT

Subject: PSCO

Dave,

Wanted to give you a heads up...

We are looking at a DASH for approximately $1.5MM for development of PSCO.  
This includes cancellation charges of approximately $350K and soft 
engineering/consulting costs through November 30 (expected receipt of air 
permit).  The plan would be to DASH with Board/Exec Committee approval the 
entire project in November.   Chip Schneider of RAC is OK with this approach 
given his understanding of the project risks and economics.  

The plan is to keep this off balance sheet through West LB -> Turbo Park  
with exit to a third party no later than Sep 30, 2001.  there is likely a 
need to bring in LJM to cover $2-3MM of hard costs (moving dirt) from Dec 1 
through Jan 31.

We are planning on executing the PPA with PSCO this week - it has sufficient 
conditions precedent to give ENA Legal (and me) comfort that we can walk if 
there is any problem with permits or site costs (land, water, transmission, 
fuel).  In addition, there is a Board out that ENA Legal drafted, negotiated 
and feels is a tangible out (unlike most Board outs).  We will have a 
definitive deal with NEPCO prior to execution of the PSCO PPA.  I spoke  with 
Jacoby and  Janet and told them we are planning to take the remaining two 
LM6000's for this project.

I am available to talk about it at your convenience.

Regards,

Chris

To: Chip Schneider/NA/Enron@Enron
cc: Stephen Thome/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff G Slaughter/PDX/ECT@ECT 
Subject: PSCO

Chip,

PSCO has modified their position and has accepted some of our negotiating 
points (heat rate, board out, permit conditions precedent) and will accept a 
6-LM6000 project with a June 2001 start date.  The additional two LM6000's 
materially improves our economics as both installed cost/kw and fixed o&m 
decrease.  We plan on executing the PPA later this week (Monday 10/16 latest) 
with inclusion of project permitting conditions and Board-out language 
drafted by and satisfactory to ENA Legal.

In order to hit the June 01 deadline, we must order the following additional 
equipment through West LB ASAP:

6 stacks  $1,188,000
3 Control Modules $375,000
1 CEMS  $675,000
4 230kv Breakers $340,000
Total:   $2,578,000

The above equipment is needed for our remaining LM6000's in any project.  
More importantly, the cancellation charges for the above equipment are 
minimal as follows:

Now through November 1:    $257,800
Now through November 30:  $340,000 (additional $83,000)

Additional soft costs prior to mobilization in December are estimated at:

EE&CC Tasking Letter Year to Date:  $175,000
EE&CC/NEPCO Engineering through October 20:  $75,000
EE&CC/NEPCO Engineering through Nov 30: $700,000

Based on the above, I will exceed $500K around October 18.  Given our Board 
approval flexibility from PSCo and the timing of expediting the equipment 
orders, I thought it might be a good idea to seek approval for a development 
project through the end of November (or perhaps December 15). The amount 
might be $1.5MM which allows for equipment cancellation and engineering 
costs.  That would allow us to move forward aggressively and prepare a more 
complete final project approval for the next regularly scheduled Board / Exec 
Committe meeting in November.

How does this sound to you?

Regards,

Chris

I was curious whether you thought it was a good idea for me to attend the Finance Committee meetings on a going forward basis (in the event of any LJM  discussion, or otherwise)?  I would be happy to do so, but my feelings won't be bruised if you think it unnecessary.


On a somewhat related point, during my last meeting with Rick Causey of about two weeks ago, Rick suggested that the three of us get together monthly to discuss what transactions are being discussed with LJM (or may have even closed during that time period), our related internal reviews, and documentation.  Are you ok with this arrangement?

Thanks.

Sara,

Since you're out the rest of the week from noon tomorrow, we'd really 
appreciate it if you could prepare a revised confirm tomorrow morning so we 
can deliver it to LJM for their review. Then, we can hopefully sign the 
confirm on Monday. Thanks!

Scott

Mark,

Per our conversation, here are the items we would like specific guidance on from outside counsel as soon as possible:

1.  Regarding the 4 undelivered routes (Memphis to D.C., San Diego to Austin, Seattle to Vancouver, and Salt Lake to Denver), what is the probability someone could buy the contracts from 360 and "Put" the routes to EBS?

2.  If 360 were to reject the contracts where they pay EBS annual lease payments (Amarillo to Austin and Houston to New Orleans):
	How would the court go about calculating EBS' damages (would future payments be included)?
	Would we have the right to offset the damages against future lease payments to them?
	Would EBS get the fibers back?

3.  Regarding the swap where EBS delivered its route to 360 over a year ago, and 360 delivered Minneapolis to Detroit 1-2 weeks previous to filing (papered as one deal):
	What is the probability this would be viewed as a preferential transaction?
	If preferential, would the entire swap unwind, or could the court unwind only the 360 delivery?

4.  If 360 rejects IRUs where they have paid EBS (or LJM/Trust) the total amount up-front, what is the probability EBS will have to refund all or a portion of the money?

5.  Worst case scenario, if 360 rejects all contracts where they are paying EBS for future O&M and Collocation:
	How would the court go about calculating EBS' damages (would future payments be included)?
	Would we have the right to offset the damages against future payments to them for O&M and Collocation?

Thanks again for your help.
Jim B.

Subject:	EWC - Weekly Update/Week Ending 27 April


1.  Aura.
     -  Received revised bid from UBS which Metts describes as "real."  UBS
will now commence detailed 6-8 week due diligence on EWC (at Enron's
expense if deal busts).  Confidence re: UBS' ability to execute remains
mixed.
     -  LJM (Fastow) interest continues, but unclear how parallel process
can be run.  Umanoff concerned about conflict when management assists
seller as part of UBS deal but assists buyer as part of LJM deal.
     -  Now that '01 numbers scrubbed, in process of revising '02 financial
projections based on detailed internal review (as of December, 2000, '02
EBITDA projected at approximately $115mm; up from 1CE '01 projection of
$78mm). This is unrealistic; I expect 2002 EBITDA in the $90-95mm range,
showing solid 15-20% EBITDA growth.

2.  M&A Activity.
     -  acquisition of assets of bankrupt Dutch blade manufacturer, Aerpac,
continues; we have closed on several assets and expect final closing in
May.
     -  sale of Greek operating projects to German buyer continues, but
execution uncertain.  Closing targeted for June 30.  Sale of Greek
development company also launched, with 2 parties expressing interest.

3.  2001 Commercial Activity.
     -  US backlog remains firm.  Projected demand continues to exceed our
projected turbine supply.  Key execution issue is confimation of
suitability of 1.5 MW turbine (primarily its gearbox) in more rigorous US
wind regimes.
     -  American Electric Power has provided indicative bid to purchase the
two Texas projects we have under development (Indian Mesa I and Clear Sky);
indicative bid price is attractive.  AEP has requested Enron Corp guaranty
of EWC's turbine warranty, like they have received on previous sales with
EWC.  Enron Corp guaranty is approved internally, but, in light of Aura,
we will continue to bargain for no Enron Corp credit support. Finally, debt
financing expected to close on IMI in May and debt circled on Clear Sky in
June.  Turbine suitability due diligence is key pacing item for debt
closing.
     -  European backlog remains firm, expect for Spanish sales of 750kw
turbine, which remains soft. EWC attended Hannover Fair last week, the
largest industrial trade show in Europe.  Our exhibit was very well
received.  CEO of German competitor, Enercon, approached Umanoff to discuss
IP issues (Enercon is currently barred from US market on patent
infringement grounds).

4.  HR Issues.
     -  US has lost O&M director and 2 key commercial employees have
expressed concerns.  Need to finalize retention program (Umanoff to discuss
with Horton early in week).
     -  Key recruiting initiatives are: GM Spain; head of global
procurement/blade MFG; European GC.  Umanoff would also like to re-visit
hiring US GM/MD, as day-to-day US operations require more detailed
oversight than Umanoff is currently providing; not clear if we can recruit
for this position in the midst of Aura.

Stan - for the future, please let me know whether this is the right level
of focus.  Talk with you soon. Adam

Mike- I just spoke with fellow attorneys here in the Swap Group and was made 
aware it would be more appropriate for Scott Sefton's group to handle the 
drafting of an Agreement which entails Enron Corp. receiving all the assets 
of the LJM Swap Sub and making a payment of $30 m. to LJM Equity Partners.

With respect to the Rhythms Net Options component, I have included below the 
language which we discussed on the telephone. I would imagine this (or 
something similar) would need to be included in the document that Scott's 
group prepares. 

I apologize for the mix-up.

Kind regards,

Pagan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike J Miller/HOU/ECT@ECT
cc: Sheila Tweed/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enron 

Subject: Call w/ John Schroeder of GE

I talked with John a few minutes ago. Here's the gist of the conversation:

1. Miller was promised the 4 7FAs based on his discussions with John 
concerning Enron's interest. GE is wavering a bit on this now, however, 
because other sales reps within GE have complained that we were given first 
crack. John characterized our current position as "the front of the line 
without a pass".

2. Ultimately (and obviously), Dell Williamson will decide to whom these 
turbines are allocated.

3. John said we should have a proposed letter agreement on the turbines this 
afternoon. He emphasized that they do not yet have the requisite GE internal 
approvals. Nonetheless, the major terms included in the Letter Agreement 
would be as follows:
- Form of turbine purchase contract would be the GenPower 7FA turbine 
purchase agreement, modified to include standard Enron provisions negotiated 
between Sheila Tweed et. al. concerning assignment, indemnities, etc.;
- the turbine purchase contract would need to be executed by the end of 
January;
- 5% of the purchase amount would need to be paid upon execution of the 
Letter Agreement, with an additional 5% due at the end of the month. The 
balance of payments in the turbine purchase agreement would be paid in equal 
monthly instalments for each turbine through the respective turbine's 
delivery date (last day of each of March, April, May, and June);
- we would be required to negotiate with GE in good faith on an LTSA, water 
system and STG (if needed). This would not be an exclusive, nor would we be 
subject to payment adders to the extent our good faith negotiations do not 
result in a definitive agreement.
- the Letter Agreement will not be drafted as an option (even though it will 
essentially operate as one), but instead will be a letter agreement for the 
purchase of turbines. Unfortunately, the semantics of this are both important 
to us and GE, but I believe it will be extremely difficult to do anything 
other than the form and semantics that GE wants (as we are competing with 
other buyers who do not have the same balance sheet constraints as us). As 
such, we may want to consider an interim OBS vehicle such as LJM if the 
looseness of the contract presents challenges for the TurboPark banks.

Lastly, given the somewhat tenuous nature of our queue position on the 
turbines, John strongly suggested that Delainey be immediately briefed, and 
that he call Dell as soon as possible based on the information John provided 
me in our conversation described above. He also suggested that we indicate to 
Dell that we have firm sites  (Florida and Longview) for the units. John told 
me that this latter point is important to GE as they are becoming fatigued by 
their other customers who have slues of turbines and not enough sites to 
accommodate them.

Let me know if you have any other questions. FYI, I put in a call to Lisa 
Bills on this deal, but have still not heard back from her.

Regards,

Ben

I've attached my comments by redlining Change Order #2 to the Blue Dog 
turbine contract.  The main points were 1) to replace EE&CC with ENA as the 
Agent to E-Next Generation LLC and 2) to have 30 days to pay the invoice.  
The E-Next Generation payment process is to receive ONE advance each month on 
the 15th, therefore I could not guarantee payment within 10 days of receipt 
of invoice.

Ace,

I'm a lawyer at ENA.  We are selling some of our peakers, and in conjunction 
with the sale we have agreed to not contest Siemens Westinghouse retaining 
the Blue Girl reservation payments.  SW has asked that LJM sign off on the 
agreement, and Rose has suggested that I send the original agreements to you, 
and indicated that she would help coordinate signature.

Your help is appreciated.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Stuart,

If you need a copy of the executed Westinghouse letter, you can find the 
original on my desk, I believe on the left hand corner (looking out).  The 
letter we are waiting for is merely an acknowledgement that LJM doesn't need 
to sign.  I think getting the letter is probably belts and suspenders, but I 
requested it anyway.

I just came back from a meeting with Accounting (Ryan Siueck) and Credit (Rod 
Nelson - works with Bill Bradford) in which we presented the two-factor model 
for calculating credit loss on our LJM's position. Rod seemed positive with 
the model conceptual approach. He will position Bill Bradford on that. 
Accounting will have a meeting with AA to discuss the treatment on credit 
reserves on this deal tomorrow 9:00 AM. They feel my participation is not 
necessary. 

At year-end the difference on both valuations - without and with credit risk 
- indicates a credit loss of about 100 MM.

Vince/Stinson:

The following is an update on LJM deal:

1) I participated on a conference call with AA (Jitendra and others) and our 
Accounting/Credit Group (Wes, Bill Bradford and others) yesturday, in which 
we discussed the best approach for definining credit reserves at year-end for 
the puts we own. 
2) A big chunck of the meeting was dedicated to explain AA the details of the 
deal. Little progress was made on achieving the meeting's goal.
3) Apparently, Accounting did want to expose the calculation we made for puts 
value that considers credit risk - the two factor model we developed. That 
line of action was implied on a pre-meeting we had early that morning. From 
my understanding, Accounting argues that we should not make any credit 
reserve because we could not liquidate our position by year-end.     
4) At a certain point Jintendra suggested me to use a two factor 
MC-simulation for calculating the position with credit risk. The approach is 
actually a more simplified version of the model we have. I and nobody 
mentioned the results we got from our 2-factor model.
5) At that same afternoon I knew from Accounting that we are in a process of 
unwinding our position. 

These are the main points. Please let me know if need more details.

RE: Datacentric BroadbandAt: 2001-05-11T15:14:00.000ZFrom: gene.humphrey@enron.comTo: jeff.skilling@enron.comCC: nanBCC: nanBody:
 

  
Jeff,

After your call I thought I should give you some background on Datacentric 
Broadband (DCB). 

1. The company was founded by Leslie Anderson a woman entrepreneur in Conroe 
Texas.  Leslie continues to be the largest non institutional shareholder and 
is Chairman of the Board.  The president is Gary Remy, a Hispanic, whom you 
met recently at the YPO gathering. 

2. DCB is in the broadband wireless access market focusing on smaller cities 
in Texas.  They have deployed in nine different locations and have a strategy 
to grow from a regional player to a national player.  The market they are in 
requires no license fees and is one where being first to locate in a city is 
critical to success.

3. We have invested $2 million in DCB to date and brought in Redstone 
Investors who also invested $2 million. Redstone should continue to 
participate with us in any future investments we make in DCB.

4. We have talked to Kevin Garland  to solicit interest from him, however he 
made it clear that DCB was not in his target market and he was not interested 
in the investment.

5. DCB has engaged Arthur Andersen to help raise additional funds for 
continued growth.  We along with AA have been talking to other potential 
investors and have found a receptive yet cautious reception.

6. About two weeks ago we were approached by representatives of Union Pacific 
Railroad and Norfolk Southern Railroad with a proposal to invest up to $75 
million in DCB over the next five years beginning with an initial investment 
of $15 million.  U P asked if Enron would be willing to invest a similar 
amount alongside them to help DCB grow into a national broadband wireless 
access provider to smaller cities. After this request I asked Ken Rice if EBS 
would be interested in an investment in DCB either in conjunction with U P or 
on a stand alone basis.  My hope was that EBS would view DCB as a strategic 
fit to their business model and would be interested in a much closer 
relationship with DCB perhaps leading to a buyout. ( Although EBS and  DCB 
are in different businesses I know that the trading group of EBS has used DCB 
to provide liquidity and last mile access for many of their trades.)  Ken's 
response was that EBS was not interested in an investment in DCB and he 
didn't see a strategic fit between the two companies.  

7. We have also talked to Lou's group, the Xcelerator, and to LJM about 
investments in DCB and it appears that LJM is very interested in committing 
funds however I don't think they will be ready in time to match U P's 
commitment.

8.  At a subsequent meeting with U P we told them not to expect any 
additional funds from Enron other that a possible $2 to $3 million from 
ourselves since that is all of the capacity that we have left for this 
investment.  They are very disappointed that Enron does not see the strategic 
potential of this business the way they do, but nevertheless are still moving 
forward in their efforts to invest in DCB in the $75 million range.  We are 
currently in the due diligence process with U P and hope to wrap up a deal 
structure by the end of May.

  We have solicited the support of other Enron groups all along the way while 
making our investment decision.  I truly believe that DCB is in a space that 
could be very integral to the success of EBS and had hoped that we could work 
together more closely, however EBS does not see a strategic fit with DCB.  We 
will continue to develop relationships with other strategic and financial 
partners in order to enhance and grow the value of our investment in DCB.

 I will be happy to talk to you further about DCB and our investment.  We 
will of course seek your approval for any additional investments that we make 
in DCB.  Please call me if you have any additional questions.

Gene

GE (S & S) - I've spoken with Lee Johnson (commercial lead) and have traded 
voice mails with Kent Shoemaker regarding the project specific turbine 
contracts.  I'm requesting a meeting with them on Thursday to iron our 
details.    I requested a revised draft this week (from Andrews & Kurth), but

ABB - I've swapped calls with Mike Sandrige (their commercial lead) about it,

are not expected.  Initial draft of the project specific contracts has been 
prepared.

Blue Dog - Is that GE equipment? Sheila may have someone she wants to work on

Subject: Turbine Purchase Agreements - Urgent Assignment Issues

Hi -

We are fast approaching the time when  we will need to assign equipment 
purchase agreements to either the "Developer" in the CSFB structure, to ENA 
(I think) in the Austin deal or, more urgently, to WestLB in connection with 
a deal in which LJM is currently the nominal purchaser.  The LJM deal is 
called "Blue Dog" and ENA has decided it wants those turbines.

Blue Dog-

Lisa has her folks talking to WLB regarding the Blue Dog contract and Rob 
Taylor has contacted Winston & Strawn about a new ADA.   We will need to 
contact GE about the transfer (actually it will be two transfers - one to WLB 
and then into the "Developer" in the CSFB structure).  
Who at ENA legal should I work with  to get that process started?  Both Rob 
and I have the turbine purchase agreement and can get it to the ENA lawyer.   

Austin -

The Austin turbines are the LMs - that purchase agreement contemplates that 
the new buyer will execute another agreement with (GE/S&S) covering the 
turbines it acquires.   Is that structure still contemplated?  Is there 
another way to do this that would be easier from a labor perspective?   I 
assume ENA will then be assigning the equipment on to the project company or 
EPC contractor, also.


CSFB Structure -

More generally we will need to get buy-in from vendors on the assignment of 
the purchase contracts.  Is this an appropriate topic for the the World 
Hunger discussion tomorrow?  Are there other vendors who need to be contacted 
on this also?


Thanks for your help,


Rose

Randy,

Hedges in the Raptor structure require that a Proposal Sheet be submitted to 
the counterparty to the swap (the counterparty is owned by an outside 
investor and our agreement with them requires this). Attached to Mary's email 
below is the Raptor Derivative Proposal Sheet that the business unit will 
need to submit. Gordon is responsible for this process and can answer any 
questions you have.

Also attached below is a Raptor Securities/Confidentiality Response Form that 
ENA legal prepared to help them conduct a due diligence exercise on their 
merchant assets being hedged to confirm that there were no contractual or 
other legal restrictions that may affect their ability to enter into the 
swap. Although  many of the items on this form won't be relevant to what 
you're hedging, I thought it may be helpful. Because we're not familiar with 
the assets or any South American legal issues that may apply, we'll be 
looking to you for confirmation that there aren't any issues in this regard.

You can ignore the document entitled Raptor Process for Inclusion of Swaps 
into Raptor Vehicles.

Please call me or Gordon if you have any questions. Thanks!

Subject: Call w/ John Schroeder of GE

I talked with John a few minutes ago. Here's the gist of the conversation:

1. Miller was promised the 4 7FAs based on his discussions with John 
concerning Enron's interest. GE is wavering a bit on this now, however, 
because other sales reps within GE have complained that we were given first 
crack. John characterized our current position as "the front of the line 
without a pass".

2. Ultimately (and obviously), Dell Williamson will decide to whom these 
turbines are allocated.

3. John said we should have a proposed letter agreement on the turbines this 
afternoon. He emphasized that they do not yet have the requisite GE internal 
approvals. Nonetheless, the major terms included in the Letter Agreement 
would be as follows:
- Form of turbine purchase contract would be the GenPower 7FA turbine 
purchase agreement, modified to include standard Enron provisions negotiated 
between Sheila Tweed et. al. concerning assignment, indemnities, etc.;
- the turbine purchase contract would need to be executed by the end of 
January;
- 5% of the purchase amount would need to be paid upon execution of the 
Letter Agreement, with an additional 5% due at the end of the month. The 
balance of payments in the turbine purchase agreement would be paid in equal 
monthly instalments for each turbine through the respective turbine's 
delivery date (last day of each of March, April, May, and June);
- we would be required to negotiate with GE in good faith on an LTSA, water 
system and STG (if needed). This would not be an exclusive, nor would we be 
subject to payment adders to the extent our good faith negotiations do not 
result in a definitive agreement.
- the Letter Agreement will not be drafted as an option (even though it will 
essentially operate as one), but instead will be a letter agreement for the 
purchase of turbines. Unfortunately, the semantics of this are both important 
to us and GE, but I believe it will be extremely difficult to do anything 
other than the form and semantics that GE wants (as we are competing with 
other buyers who do not have the same balance sheet constraints as us). As 
such, we may want to consider an interim OBS vehicle such as LJM if the 
looseness of the contract presents challenges for the TurboPark banks.

Lastly, given the somewhat tenuous nature of our queue position on the 
turbines, John strongly suggested that Delainey be immediately briefed, and 
that he call Dell as soon as possible based on the information John provided 
me in our conversation described above. He also suggested that we indicate to 
Dell that we have firm sites  (Florida and Longview) for the units. John told 
me that this latter point is important to GE as they are becoming fatigued by 
their other customers who have slues of turbines and not enough sites to 
accommodate them.

Let me know if you have any other questions. FYI, I put in a call to Lisa 
Bills on this deal, but have still not heard back from her.

Regards,

Ben

Louise,

We were trying to set a meeting for Thursday when Brian returns from Japan, but based on your note it may not be necessary.  Brian and I have discussed and we do not see this developmental activity fitting the new charter of EEOS. The opportunities if any would have to be for NEPCO and based on the activity in the year, it is difficult to see a cost/benefit analysis favorable for them. We support your decision of transferring the ownership of this endeavor to EA. We could work a deal with respect to potential benefit via NEPCO based on a finder's fee concept to EA if the fund provides a negotiated project for NEPCO. 

My check of the accounting agrees with yours and we will need to work out a transfer concept for the monies paid to-date.  As far as the asset is concerned, the only relief we could provide is of the aspirin variety for our bosses as we end up in Wholesale also.

Keith

Keith/Brian,

The following money has been sent to AIG Highstar to date.  This week we will be asked for further monies (probably around $650,000 each)
to pay for the acquisition of Alamac from Enron.

EEOS   $914,107   
ENA       914,107
          ------------------
          $1,828,214  (fundings made in 12\00 and 2\01)

I would suggest that we look at transferring all of this to Enron Americas as we are actively managing the position (or rather looking at potential exit strategies) bearing in mind the new status of EEOS.  The management of this is done by Joe Deffner as the primary role of this fund was to be a new vehicle for financing similar to LJM.  Obviously, Enron Americas does not want the asset so if you do, please keep it.  

I am meeting with the head of funds at AIG in a July to discuss the future of this fund further.  Let me know what you want to do.

Thanks

Louise

Subject: Update on Pastoria and Las Vegas Sale

Dave,

We made good progress last week on the sale of Pastoria and Las Vegas.    
Kelemen is doing a great job.

In general, Calpine is more agressive and can move quicker than AES - AES has 
one small team on both deals and is slower at turning docs.  Without giving 
up any rights or discouraging AES from pursuing Pastoria, we are trying to 
position AES on LV and keep Calpine's value for Pastoria close to their 
original bid.

Calpine - Pastoria
Early in the week, Calpine clawed back about $12 million from their bid 
primarily by claiming that the turbine contract is overpriced by $10 million, 
and their bid assumed  "market" for the turbines.   While they are correct 
(the extra $10 million for Catalytica), we have gotten most of that back.  
There bid now is $37MM (vs. $41) plus up to $5MM if the contingency is not 
used between signing and closing.  Calpine also wanted to include other 
permits (other than CEC) as conditions precedent and they wanted us to rep 
that the scheduled permits are the only ones required to construct and 
operate.  This is far too onerous and we are pushing back on this.  Our plan 
is to get a PSA that only has HSR and CEC permit as conditions precedent.  
The other negotiating item is with respect to mechanics of continuing the 
development between signing and closing, and who pays for it and who is at 
risk.  This is relevant if you think of the scenario where incremental costs 
are necessary in order to get the Non-appealable CEC Permit.  

AES - Pastoria
Same PSA issues as above, but AES seems more skiddish about the development 
risks (other than CEC).  They want to change some of the EPC contract terms, 
they want a more-involved transition team and  they want us to take more risk 
on post-signing/pre-closing development.  Their bid was $27million plus 
upside for the 250MW expansion and a services agreement for fuel supply and 
schedule coordination services.  We have given them term sheets that provide 
for an extra $10 million for the 250MW expansion and approximately $750,000 
per year of risk-free service revenues.  They have not yet responded.  By 
contrast, Calpine does not want to use NEPCO, and they dont want our services 
or any material ongoing involvement (cleaner).  

CEC Process:
On Thursday night we received the Presiding Members Proposed Decision (PMPD), 
recommending approval of the Project.  By statute, this is one month early 
and the quickest in California to date.  This is a 400 page document and we 
are combing through it to determine any material changes from our original 
filing and the original staff assessment - none detected yet.  The stated 
process is that we would receive our CEC permit on December 20, after which 
their is a 30 day appeal period.  If there is no appeal, the process is done 
Jan 19.  For purposes of handicapping the risk, we have already gone through 
the public hearing process.  While there was some intervention, our remote 
site is not in the environmental/NIMBY crosshairs like other projects.  In 
order for the appeal process to derail the timing, someone needs to show that 
(i) a law was broken or (ii) the CEC analysis is seriously flawed.  In the 
past two years five plants were approved and only one was appealed - this was 
due to a resident that was not notified and therefore the project broke the 
law.   This caused a 4 month delay.   The two bidders will not take the risk 
on the CEC permit getting appealed.  In Calpine's words, it would look pretty 
bad on Wall Street if they had to write off a $40MM development fee paid to 
Enron for nothing! 

AES-Las Vegas
They seem genuinely interested in the asset - more the expansion than the 
QF.  They like LM6000's and think they are great resource for the location.  
We told them they are behind the other bidders both on time and value.  They 
have reviewed the EPC contract and understand the quality of the LD's, 
liability limits and the consortium EPC group.  They indicated that they have 
no problem with getting incremental insurance in order to protect the value 
of hitting June, 2002.  They want to meet with the EPC group and provide 
input to the notice to proceed.  Closing for them on this deal is a little 
cleaner than Pastoria because we have the permits in hand, and it is not as 
big a bet (smaller asset, existing operation, less political risk, etc.).   
Our plan is to turn the PSA one more time (Monday) and then tell them that if 
they get their bid up a few million ($26MM to say $30MM), we will focus on 
them for a week or so to try to get it closed.  

Deal Timing - Pastoria: Firm up Calpine on value and risk allocation during 
the next week and aim for signing and HSR filing on December 1.  Sometime 
before December 1 we need to finalize our plans with respect to earnings 
recognition.  We have been talking with Deffner, Westfall and lawyers about 
different structures involving either (i) LJM; (ii) AIG; or (iii) selling to 
Calpine with liquidated damages relating to CEC Permit.  As you can imagine, 
there are pros and cons to each approach.  We expect to know more on this by 
Wednesday of this week and will update you at that time.

Deal Timing - Las Vegas: The only condition precedent should be the HSR.  If 
they can move quicker, we will target December 1 to sign and late Dec to 
close.   The urgency relates to schedule - the longer we wait, the greater 
the risk of missing June 2002 COD.  With respect to QIV earnings, AES' bid 
results in a $6MM hit.  Signing the deal to sell reduces fair market 
valuation.  Two possibilities we are exploring: If AES increases its bid, the 
hit may be neglibible; alternatively we may be able to discount the LM6000's 
being sold to them, which may not show up as a hit since the LM6000 pool is 
accrual and being sold into Turbopark.  Like the Pastoria analysis, we will 
know more this week and will update you when we know.   


Regards,

Chris

Vince/Stinson:

The following is an update on LJM deal:

1) I participated on a conference call with AA (Jitendra and others) and our 
Accounting/Credit Group (Wes, Bill Bradford and others) yesturday, in which 
we discussed the best approach for definining credit reserves at year-end for 
the puts we own. 
2) A big chunck of the meeting was dedicated to explain AA the details of the 
deal. Little progress was made on achieving the meeting's goal.
3) Apparently, Accounting did want to expose the calculation we made for puts 
value that considers credit risk - the two factor model we developed. That 
line of action was implied on a pre-meeting we had early that morning. From 
my understanding, Accounting argues that we should not make any credit 
reserve because we could not liquidate our position by year-end.     
4) At a certain point Jintendra suggested me to use a two factor 
MC-simulation for calculating the position with credit risk. The approach is 
actually a more simplified version of the model we have. I and nobody 
mentioned the results we got from our 2-factor model.
5) At that same afternoon I knew from Accounting that we are in a process of 
unwinding our position. 

These are the main points. Please let me know if need more details.

For those of you involved in any Raptor equity investments out of JEDI I, I 
have been advised by Andrea Reed that Chewco Investments purchased a position 
in JEDI I.  Chewco is owned in part by an Enron entity.  The result is that 
Enron entities now have a 96.12% interest in JEDI I (60% ENA + 36.12% EGF 
based upon Chewco).  I hope this is helpful in your review of the Raptor 
matters.  The closing binders are in the file room for you to review if you 
need to verify the materials.   Thank you.  Mary

Attached is an update of what has been complete and what is outstanding.  We 
are missing 4 valuations; Amerada Hess, LSI Preferred (We have the warrants), 
Merlin Credit Derivative and Chewco SLP.  Of the 31 privates plus Chewco SLP, 
we have proposal sheets and confirms for only 7.  The publics have all been 
received.

We need to have the valuations, proposal sheets and confirms to Talon by 
Wednesday for their lawyers to review.  The deadline is still to have 
everything completed by this week.

Please call me if you have any questions.



Thanks,
Gordon

The attached swaps will be delivered by hard copy batch, together with the 
revised proposal sheets and a copy of the legal worksheets, to Gordon 
McKillop, in Julia Chin's absence, today.  Upon receipt, Gordon will attach 
the valuation data that has been previously provided to Julia Chin by Hope 
Vargas and coordinate execution.  

First, additional publics representing the incremental interests of Chewco, 
then followed by numerous privates.  As of now, we still are working 
Catalytica and Merlin.
