Loretta Lynch, President, California Public Utilities Commission



June 10, 2001

Lynch was appointed March 22, 2000. Previously she was director of Gov. Gray 
Davis' Office of Planning and Research.
Question: What is this summer going to be like in terms of blackouts? What is 
the economic impact going to be?

Answer: I don't think anybody can predict. They are wild guesses or at least 
estimates based on assumptions that we don't know. Three factors influence 
the level of blackouts. One is how hot it's going to be. The second is 
conservation and whether folks will really step up to the plate, both 
business and residences, and conserve their hearts out and load shift to 
non-peak times. We reduced the load 8 to 9 percent in March and April and 
slightly more (11 percent) in May. We're going to have to do better than that 
to avoid blackouts.

The third factor is making sure that the generation that can run does run and 
right now we're doing an abysmal job of that. We have record levels of 
unplanned outages at generating plants. This week 10,000 megawatts were out 
of 35,000 megawatts (42,000 megawatts including municipal utilities) in state 
capacity. Historically, there has only been 3,000 to 4,000 megawatts off at 
any one time.

Does the PUC have no control over when utilities take a plant off line?

Utilities yes, private generators no. Since November the unplanned outages 
have been three, four times what history would show over a 20-year period. 
Exactly what explains that is the heart of one of our investigations.

What can the PUC do about it?

We have been in the plants since mid-January. In January we had 25 days of 
stage 2 alerts, two days of stage 3 in 31 days. We started going in those 
plants although we've had lots of difficulty getting into plants on time and 
most importantly getting the operations and maintenance logs.

Why don't you get an injunction from a judge to tell the private companies 
they have to give the PUC everything it wants?

Frankly, because in this last 100-day period I was trying to not be that 
aggressive, I was trying to work it out with these generators. And we have 
made significant movement with some of those generators.

Is it illegal for a privately owned power company to shut down in order to 
drive up prices?

Isn't that the multibillion dollar question? That's where you match you legal 
theories.

Is the PUC joining in any of these legal actions against FERC and the private 
power generators?

You know we actually asked for help from FERC in getting data from generators 
because FERC has wide access to all sorts of market data. I talked to (former 
chairman James) Hoecker directly in September. He said, 'No problem. You just 
send us your data request and we'll make sure they comply.' But we had no 
informal help from the FERC and so we filed a motion, in November, I believe, 
for FERC to compel those people under its jurisdiction to give us basic 
documents. FERC has yet to move on those motions to compel.

Is the PUC is joining in any of the civil actions?

At this point we haven't joined in the private civil lawsuits.

What else can the PUC do?

Well there's a ton of stuff that the PUC does in front of FERC. We appear on 
electricity and natural gas issues and we continue to file formal complaints 
to that administrative agency. For instance, it was the PUC that brought the 
complaint at FERC against El Paso Corp., three weeks after I became president 
of the PUC. We complained about anti-competitive activity. We have brought 
all the motions at FERC to prevent the generators from re-upping their market 
price authority.

If FERC does nothing and allows this market-based rate authority to continue, 
what would you do?

California is experiencing the real time consequences of justice delayed is 
justice denied. Eventually the administrative procedure act would allow us to 
go to court but frankly a variety of utilities and other folks have been 
trying to kick it up to either the D.C. Circuit or the 9th Circuit. 
Preliminary responses from the courts have been that they have failed to 
exhaust administrative remedies.

What's in store for San Diego in terms of price hikes?

Bottom line, it's unrealistic to think that San Diego can continue to be 
charged in the 6 to 7 cent range when everybody else now is being charged in 
the 10 to 11 cent range. But I can't prejudge the level because we're just 
starting to hear the evidence.

How do you think the escrow accounts -- 'our individual charge accounts with 
SDG&E' -- are going to shake down eventually?

Frankly, that's an issue that's also before the commission. What the 
legislation clearly says is that there's this balancing account that San 
Diego is billing things into as a regulatory accounting matter but that's not 
the end of the inquiry. They put the money in and they charge it to a 
regulatory account and then they come to the PUC. Then the PUC judges the 
reasonableness of those charges. And the separate watch dog component of the 
PUC, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, has done some preliminary analysis on 
SDG&E's charges up through I believe August of 2000 and has questioned a 
large percentage of those charges as unreasonable because of SDG&E's failure 
to hedge when they had hedging opportunities.

Utility executives criticize the PUC on two major counts. They say only half 
the utility plants had to be divested but the PUC set the rate of return and 
other restrictions in such a fashion that it really encouraged utilities to 
dispose of the other half. Second, they say that when the PUC eventually 
allowed them to enter long-term contracts, it did not spell out procedures in 
case the contracts turned out to be unfortunate moves. How would you respond?

The first part wasn't on my watch in terms of the rate of return. That was 
set by the prior PUC. However on that question of rate of return and 50 
percent versus more I think SDG&E is a little separately situated because I 
do think there were some encouragement of SDG&E selling off in order to be 
able to merge. The rate of return may have been lower than the utilities 
wanted . . .

And the criticism about long-term contracts?

I think the long-term contract issue has been painted in simplistic terms and 
it's not a simplistic question. When the utilities came to the commission in 
2000 seeking permission the commission acted faster than it usually acts. On 
July 21 of last year PG&E and Edison came to the commission and said they 
wanted authority to enter into direct bilateral contracts. By Aug. 3 we said 
yes.

But they claim that you did not give them the ground rules.

Oh, we certainly did. We applied the historic reasonableness test. But they 
wanted an up-front guarantee that they would not be second-guessed and my 
concern on that was heightened because they have all these unregulated 
subsidiaries. Because they're now energy trading in the market . . . The 
facts are they did enter contracts and we can show you the contracts they 
entered into in August, September, October and November of last year.

When California's deregulation law was being shaped, why was nobody concerned 
about abuse of market power by the private generating companies?

It is truly astonishing and I believe it's because of an ideological bias 
from my predecessors who said, 'Well, we will have a flood of competition 
into this market because it's just a commodity.' But, in fact, this commodity 
is uniquely situated to not have a flood of competition because you have high 
capital barriers to entry. You have long lead times to increase supply. It's 
a fundamental economic necessity which can't be stored and you can't choose 
not to buy it, there's no effective substitute.

Other states such as Texas and Pennsylvania appear to be doing deregulation 
right. Do you believe it can be done right?

I think the jury's out on that question. Texas started from a position of 
supply and is energy independent and does not report to the FERC in terms of 
its own intrastate transmission grid. Pennsylvania already had an integrated 
utility sharing relationship with other states. The utilities had buy-back 
contracts with the plants that they sold so that they got long-term contracts 
at the time of sale. The utilities also sold a much smaller percentage of 
their plants. I say California went the farthest fastest with the least 
amount of safeguards.

In retrospect, what was the central flaw in this deregulation plan?

The central flaw was not to realize the market power would be exercised by 
the sellers of a fundamental economic necessity for which there is no 
effective substitute.

In the current argument over temporary price caps, the Bush administration 
says this might diminish short-term pain but in the long term would 
discourage new supply. What's your reaction to that?

My reaction is price caps or cost-based pricing is an absolute economic 
necessity for California. The market is broken. Regardless of who broke it 
and how it broke, it's broken, maybe irrevocably. Until we can make a market 
work here we must have some protection for our economy. We really are going 
back a hundred years and reaching back, these companies are re-creating the 
kinds of trust that led to trust busting.

The economy can't withstand this and in terms of the supply argument, yeah 
supply is a state issue. Gov. Davis is streamlining and we have all these 
plants being built and plus we are conserving like never before. We have 
supply coming on line, it's being built, it's not being abandoned and if it 
were abandoned in the unlikely event the people that sunk in hundreds of 
millions of dollars into an investment decided to walk and abandon their 
investment, which isn't rational economic behavior, then the utilities could 
take those over and build it at cost-based building or the power authority or 
whoever. Most of those plants entered the permitting process when the price 
cap was $250 a megawatt.

Talking about rational behavior, it's certainly in the political and economic 
interest of the Bush administration not to see California's economy go in the 
tank, not to see the economy of the whole West Coast be hammered and suffer 
accordingly. If you presume rational behavior on their part, you'd have to 
presume that they're doing what they think is the right thing.

But once again it's a question of are you going to stand on your ideology 
regardless of all facts to the contrary or are you going to try and fix given 
the actual facts that are at play in that market? I think even the most 
committed free market person, if they're principled, recognizes that you need 
a market cop in any market. This market's being gamed in a myriad of ways.

Are you getting anywhere with the FERC in making the arguments that you're 
stating here?

The question right now is who is the FERC? I have not met formally with the 
two new FERC commissioners since they've been confirmed which just occurred 
last week. I look forward to a transition period where the FERC gets off its 
ideology and gets back to practicality and doing its job as a regulator.

Will that happen as long as George Bush and Dick Cheney are saying quite the 
opposite?

California needs to do what it needs to do to protect itself, but I do think 
we may have an opportunity in transition. We can't count on it, but we 
shouldn't close the door to it.

The new electricity plants coming on line for the most part are natural 
gas-fired. Would we still be in a crunch if natural gas prices remain high?

The PUC has been doing everything it possibly can in the last two months and 
will continue to do it in the next several months to encourage utilities to 
add natural gas infrastructure. The other thing is they have to inject 
natural gas into storage right now, even though we know that the price of 
natural gas is too high. California is being gouged on natural gas.

Isn't everybody else being gouged on natural gas prices?

No, God no. Prices at the California border are two to three times higher 
than anyplace else in the country. The problem here is the El Paso line is 
the market maker for the price of gas coming in to California because of 
anti-competitive behavior which I believe was intentional to raise prices. 
That evidence is being heard at the FERC right now.

Are you expecting anything from that administrative law judge at FERC?

We have to be hopeful. The astonishing thing here is that we, California, 
cannot count on the federal government to do its job.

Good morning,

Yesterday for HE 10 and HE 11 we were cut Real Time by El Paso Electric on an import (EPMI_CISO_BLUE).  The import was cut by 30 mws and 42 mws respectively.  A purchase from the imbalance has been made.  Also for HE 12,  we bought back most of Harbor Cogeneration's schedule.  Harbor was going to run for 20 mws but could not.  We told Harbor that we would take the charge for them.  Therefore, the -20 mws of generation deviation for Harbor needs to be allocated to ECTRT as Load Deviation.  We put in a purchase of 20 mws from the imbalance in Enpower. 

Finally there is a variance for HE 17 and HE 18 possibly because of load shift from NP to SP.  We are flat in CAPS position manager.  And flat in Enpower.

Thanks,
Bill

Part 2

Scouting Houston
The Longhorns should be able to get back on the winning track Saturday night
when they host Houston at 6 p.m. in a game that will be a regional Fox
telecast.
The Cougars won their first game of the season Saturday, defeating Army,
31-30. Army had a chence to win with a 32-yard field goal on the final play
of the game, but UH defensive back Emile White blocked it.
Houston had lost its first two games, 30-27, to Rice in overtime, and 28-13
to LSU.
New Cougar coach Dana Dimel has installed an all-out passing offense and his
QB, senior Jason McKinley, is fifth in the nation in total offense with 333.3
yards per game.
The Cougars are sixth in passing with 346.3 yards per game, and WR Brian
Robinson is among the national leaders with 31 catches for 299 yards.
The Cougars gained 524 yards against Army and ran 92 plays.
Defensively, Houston has struggled.
In losing to Stanford last week, the Longhorns lost all three of the "keys to
victory" I cited in my scouting report. They lost the rushing battle, they
didn't put as much pressure on the Stanford QBs as the Cardinal defenders put
on the Texas signal callers, and they had two turnovers, while Stanford had
none.
The Cougars are far less formidable than Stanford, so Texas should win fairly
easily.
Here are three keys to victory, in my opinion:
1. Do a better job of running the football. That's not a huge order since the
Horns are averaging only 50 yards per game on the ground.
2. Protect the Texas quarterbacks. Stanford got five sacks and had tremendous
pressure on the Texas QBs most of the game.
3. Put a lot of pressure on McKinley. The Texas secondary gives up a lot of
big plays when opposing QBs have time to throw.
Long-Range Outlook
Coach Mack Brown likes to talk about four or five "key games" on the
schedule. He doesn't mean the other games are against patsies, but let's take
a look at the teams Texas plays this year.
First, there are six games the Longhorns should win. The opening victory over
Louisiana-Lafayette was one of those. The others are Houston, Oklahoma State,
Missouri, Baylor and Kansas.
If Texas takes care of business in those six games, the other five will be
the key to going 10-1 or 6-5 or somewhere in between this season.
Stanford, as Brown noted, was one of the key games, so Texas is 0-1 in the
big games. The others are Oklahoma, Colorado, Texas Tech and Texas A&M.
Texas needs to win at least three of those to have a chance to finish 9-2 and
win the Big 12's Southern Division title.
Big 12 Roundup
Texas lost at Stanford and Colorado fell to visiting Washington in the Big 12
Conference's top intersectional games Saturday, but Iowa State's Cyclones did
gain a measure of respect by whipping state rival Iowa.
This week's schedule is the last week before Big 12 play kicks off on Sept.

Recruiting Roundup

The Longhorns picked up two more commitments last week, getting LB Lance
McFarland, 6-1, 225, 4.6, of Jefferson early in the week, followed by a
pledge from his teammate, RB Anthony Johnson, 5-11, 195, 4.4, on Friday.
Johnson rushed for more than 200 yards in a loss to defending Class 3A
chamion Texarkana Libery-Eylau earlier this season. He has great power,
outstanding moves and tremendous speed. In other words, he has all the
attributes of an outstanding running back.
He also has confidence. The Longhorns already have a commitment from super
Midland Lee RB Cedric Benson, but Johnson says that doesn't worry him.
"I want to play on a great college team," he said. You're going to have
competition wherever you go if you want to play for a winning program."
His coach, Jerry Bennett, is the brother of Kansas State's defensive
coordinator, and Johnson said the Wildcats finished No. 2 on his list.
The Wildcats also were after McFarland, a hard-nosed tackle with good speed
for a linebacker. He won a "fat-boy" 100 event after his sophomore year with
an 11.3 clocking. Only players who weighed more than 200 pounds competed.
The two additions give the Longhorns 15 early commitments. It looks more and
more like the Texas coaches will award close to 25 scholarships  because they
still hope to add four of five defensive linemen, a quarterback, a tight end,
a wide receiver, a linebacker, a safety and at least one cornerback.
Seven of the Longhorns' 15 commitments are offensive linemen. Texas has
signed only three offensive linemen in each of coach Mack Brown's three
previous recruiting classes and he said heading into this recruiting season
that the offensive line was the No. 1 priority.
But he also said the defensive line was a high priority, and that is where
most of the remaining scholarships probably will be awarded.
Here's a list of the Horns' early commitments:
Offensive Line (7)
Jonathan Scott, 6-7, 290, 4.9, Dallas Carter, a national top 25 player.
Abe Robinson, 6-6, 270, 4.9, Jersey Village, a national top 100 player.
Alfio Randall, 6-6, 300, 5.1, Blinn JC, was a national top 100 player two
years ago.
Mike Garcia, 6-5, 280, 5.2, Galena Park, was the Aggies' top early pledge
before switching to UT.
Will Allen, 6-5, 300, 5.2, Cypress Falls, is in his three year as a starter.
Roman Reeves, 6-6, 295, 5.2, another of the state's top eight offensive
linemen.
Terrance Young, 6-6, 340, 5.5, Longview, is tremendously strong and had
offers from several top schools before committing to Texas.
Running Back (2)
Cedric Benson, 5-11, 200, 4.5, Midland Lee, the greatest Class 5A rusher and
scorer in state history and a national top 25 player.
Anthony Johnson, 5-11, 195, 4.4, Jefferson, No. 19 on my top 25 list.
Linebacker (2)
Yamil LeBron, 6-2, 240, 4.7, Killeen Ellison, was the middle backer the
Longhorns targeted early.
Lance McFarland, 6-1, 225, 4.6, Jefferson, No. 23 on my top 25 list.
Defensive Back (4)
Cedric Griffin, 6-1, 180, 4.42, San Antonio Holmes, one of the state's top
two cornerbacks.
Kendal Briles, 5-10, 175, 4.5, Wolfforth Frenship, a great option QB who will
play safety at Texas.
Braden Johnson, 6-2, 200, 4.5, Euless Trinity, a fine athlete who is playing
QB this season.
Brian Carter, 5-11, 180, 4.5, The Woodlands, a two-way star at WR and CB.
RECRUITING NOTES: Super FB James Buchanon of Sarasota, Fla., plans to take
his official visit to Texas this weekend. . . DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia HS
in Placentia, Cal., says he will visit this weekend or the following weekend.
Jakes is playing nose guard this year and said he had two sacks and several
other tackles for losses in Valencia's opening 24-0 victory over Palmdale
Highland. He said Highland is supposed to have a playoff-caliber team "and we
really shut them down." Jakes lived in Plano when he was in junior high and
he said he is strongly considering coming to UT. "I really like the way
football is king in Texas," he said. . . Super DT Tommie Harris of Killeen
Ellison and outstanding OL William Winston of Houston Madison both say they
plan to come to the Houston game this weekend on unofficial visits. Harris is
the nation's top DT prospect, and Winston is a dominating OL.  . . UT pledge
Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity rallied his team from a 14-3 third-quarter
deficit to a 17-14 victory over Arlington Martin by running 58 and 1 yards
for TDs. . . DE Eric Hall of Clarksville, Tenn., took his official visit to
Texas the Sept. 9 weekend and said he really enjoyed it. He said Texas is his
favorite right now, but said he wants to take some other visits before
committing to anyone. Hall was born in Fort Hood and, like Jakes, says he has
fond memories of Texas football.

Satchell, Richardson Status

Two Longhorn freshmen football players, linebacker Aurmon Satchell and RB
Tyrone Richardson, have been lost to the team for at least this semester.
Satchell and Richardson both said they have some academic issues that need to
be resolved before they can return. Both said they hope to be back in January.
Satchell is from Denver Jefferson and Richardson is from Clarksville.

True Orange Observations

Coach Mack Brown is in his third year of what should have been a major
rebuilding job at Texas.
Thanks to the way he and his assistants took charge and changed one of the
nation's worst defenses into one of its best, and thanks to the way they
recruit, the Longhorns are already back among the nation's elite.
I know they lost at Stanford. I didn't like it. The coaches and players
didn't like it either. It bothers them even more than it bothers us.
But Texas hasn't finished among the nation's top 10 in football since 1983,
so we probably all expected too much from this team. The Horns will finish in
the top 10 again very soon and probably next year if not this one.
With three great recruiting classes already in school and a fourth in the
making, there are going to be a lot more W's than L's in the weeks and years
ahead.
Let's be grateful for what he and his assistants and players have
accomplished and help them get back on the winning track.

Gustafson's Lawsuit Dismissed

State District Judge J. Scott McCown ruled last week that former Longhorn
baseball coach Cliff Gustafson's lawsuit against UT athletic director DeLoss
Dodds has no merit and he dismissed it.
McCown also said Dodds has official immunity from such a lawsuit.
The lawsuit alleged that Dodds falsified an outside income statement by
Gustafson and provided false information to then-UT president Robert Berdahl
that Gustfson has violated university rules by maintaining a non-university
bank account for a baseball camp. The suit alleged Dodds' actions forced him
to resign.
The judge ordered Gustafson to pay Dodds' court costs.

Basketball Recruiting

T. J. Ford, the outstanding point guard at Fort Bend Willowridge, says he had
a great visit to Texas the Sept. 9 weekend, but isn't ready to commit to
anyone until he looks at some other schools.
UCLA probably is the Horns' main competition for Ford, a super quick 5-11
star who is the state's No. prospect. He  led Willowridge to the state Class
5A title and a 36-1 record last season.
Coach Rick Barnes only has one more scholarship to award, so UT's recruiting
will be over for this year if Ford commits to the Longhorns.
The Longhorn women are going to get a visit late this month from Kala Bowers,
a 6-2 forward from Woodward, Okla.
She is a national top 25 star who plays on a team that has lost only two
games in the last two years.
Coach Jody Conradt already has a pledge from the state's top prospect, 6-2
forward Heather Schreiber of Windthorst.

Kelly to Miss Fall Semester

Senior guard Darren Kelly  will miss the fall semester, Longhorn basketball
coach Rick Barnes announced last week. Kelly hopes to return to game action
for the Longhorns following the fall semester.
"It is going to be difficult not being able to play this fall, but I have
some academic issues that I need to take care of to return to the team,"
Kelly said. "I am going to attempt to take care of that this fall and hope to
rejoin the team in December."
Kelly was slated to return for his second season as the team's starting
shooting guard. He earned Big 12 Conference All-Newcomer and All-Bench team
recognition as a junior, averaging 10 points and 3.1 rebounds per game.
He was third on the squad in scoring and second in assists (81) last season.
He also was the top three-point shooter on the team and second-best in the
Big 12 (.452), including a .500 mark in league play (25-of-50).
"I'm sad for Darren because he had made such great strides in his game during
the latter part of last year and over the summer, and he had really taken a
strong leadership role on this team," Barnes said.
"With the addition of so many new guys this year, there's no question that
his loss in the fall will hurt us. Hopefully he'll be able to return to the
team and give us a big lift heading into Big 12 Conference play."

Jefferson LB Lance McFarland Says He Is Committing to Horns

Linebacker Lance McFarland, 6-1, 225, 4.6, of Jefferson told me tonight
(Tuesday) he is trying to call UT assistant coach Darryl Drake to commit to
the Longhorns.
"I just decided I was ready to get the recruiting process behind me," he
said. "I have always liked Texas and I'm ready to give my commitment."
He said he has scholarship offers from Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Arkansas,
Kansas State and LSU.
McFarland has great speed for a linebacker. He won the so-called "fat boy
100" at an East Texas track meet with an 11.3 clocking after his sophomore
year. Only players who weighed more than 200 pounds competed in the event.
He will be the Longhorns' 14th commitment. The others are super RB Cedric
Benson of Midland Lee, OLs Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of
Jersey Village, Matt Garcia of Galena Park, Will Allen of Cypress Falls,
Roman Reeves of Livingston, Terrance Young of Longview and Alfio Randall of
Blinn JC; LB Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison, CB Cedric Griffin of San
Antonio Holmes, WR-CB Brian Carter of The Woodlands, DB Braden Johnson of
Euless Trinity and QB/S Kendal Briles of Wolfforth Frenship.
Benson and Scott are national top 25 players and Robinson and Briles also
have made some national top 100 lists.
FB James Buchanon of Sarasota, Fla., DE Kaelen Jakes of Valencia, Cal., and
OL Williams Winston of Houston Madison all say they plan to come to the
UT-Houston game Sept. 23. Buchanon and Jakes will be taking their official
visits to Texas that weekend.
I said I wouldn't have any more faxes this week, and here this one is, but
it
is shorter than usual because I have a very early flight to California
Wednesday and I have to get this going so I can shut everything down before
I
leave. For those of you who normally get late faxes early the nexrt
morning,
I apologize for sending this one so late, but it was either do it now or at
4:30 a.m. tomorrow.
* * * *
The True Orange Fax Service includes  at  least  99 faxes  a year and costs
$99 ($79 by E-Mail). The True Orange Newsletter includes  26 newsletters
and
is published weekly during football season and twice monthly during most of
the other months. It costs $45. Save by subscribing to both for $130 (or
$110
if you take the faxes via E-Mail  or $99 if you take the faxes and
newsletter
via E-Mail). Send check  to address at the top of page. I also  update my
900 number

- 1-900-288-8839

Jeff Green's telephone number is 707-964-7346.? He's a busy guy, also.? Isn't 
country living supposed to be relaxing?

February 10, 1999

I am wakened by the approaching chatter of the early morning call to
prayer (sounding a bit like the fuss made by one of those cartoon balls
of fighting dogs and cats).  From the minarets of far away mosques, the
muezzins' cries ricochet through Istanbul's still dark alleys and
streets.  Seagulls, who have drifted up the hill from the Golden Horn,
squawk contentedly outside my window.  From somewhere down below, a
miserable dog joins into the pre-dawn ruckus, soon followed by the local
muezzin, whose amplified singing drowns out all the rest.  He reminds us
that God is great and that prayer is a whole lot more important than
sleep (at least that's what I've been told; he sings in Arabic).
Because my religion thinks more highly of sleep, I feel free to simply
listen, while gently trying to pull the warm blanket of sleep back over
me.  The  muezzin has a beautiful voice.  Its rise and fall stitches
itself into the edges of a dream (in which a former best friend and I
argue about the rules of a game of miniature golf) hanging just out of
reach.

Slowly, the banal calculations that fill my days begin to crowd their
way into my head.  It's about a quarter to six, I figure, which means
there's time for a bit of writing, or even Turkish vocabulary, before I
douse myself in the shower to full consciousness.  I remind myself of
the theory that one can write most freely while still intoxicated with
sleep (or just plain intoxicated), am immediately stricken with the fear
I am incapable of such freedom, take a look round my brain for something
worth writing about (find nothing), hypothesize about the advantages of
a quick dash into the hallway to turn on the gas heater (so that when I
really get up it will be reasonably warm out there), wonder if I really
do have enough stuff prepared to fill up the two hours of my English
lesson with Suleyman, conclude that all this thinking has probably made
any more sleep impossible, then (I realize later) fall back to sleep.

                               *     *     *

My new phone [(212) 292-6486] is hooked up and I have a new internet
server, which will make it much easier to keep in touch.  Hope to attack
that backlog of responses that are due.

Keep in touch.

RE: riding mendocinoAt: 2001-06-12T11:05:00.000ZFrom: afinch@iasco.comTo: jeff.dasovich@enron.comCC: nanBCC: nanBody:
Hi Jeff,

Madeleine asked that I forward this to you at this email address.  Looks
like we may have a small group going to Mendocino in September (maybes for
Pat Scatena, Madeleine and Nora, and my husband and I are definitely going).
Let me know if you are interested.




I heard back from Ricochet Ridge (from Lari's executive assistant) that
the
weekend of September 21-23 (Friday through Sunday) would work best for
them
to host an advanced group.

We should probably confirm as soon as possible, and start looking for
accommodations, given that September is a popular time in Mendocino.

Her prices this year are $195.00 per person for an all-day ride (they
generally start at 9ish and finish at around 3:30 or 4:00).  We provide
our
own lunch, or for $10 more per person, the ranch will pack us lunch.
Four-hour rides are $125.00, and can include beach, redwoods or both.
The
all-day rides are great, because you can go a little farther and get a
nice
lunch break, usually with a view.  But another option would be to do a
four-hour ride each day, selecting either beach or forest, to reduce the
cost somewhat.

Please let me know if you can make it, and what days you would like to
ride
(Friday, Saturday and/or Sunday), and whether you prefer the all-day or
four-hour option.  When I know general numbers, we can decide if we
would
like to get a house (if any are available) or if a hotel/B&B option
would
work better.

[IMAGE]	[IMAGE] 	[IMAGE]	 [IMAGE]   June 7, 2001   [IMAGE]  --Steve Fox, editor in chief, CNET.com     Dear readers, I can't resist a good fight: Napster vs. the RIAA, Intel vs. AMD, Palm vs. Pocket PC. But in my opinion, nothing beats the PC vs. Mac rivalry. It's an ongoing conflict that has generated more bad blood, accusatory e-mails (just ask any tech editor), and overall charges of press bias than any other high-tech confrontation imaginable. The responsible folks on the CNET Software team considered playing peacemaker to the warring tribes, possibly building consensus and even trying to heal old wounds. But that wouldn't be much fun, would it? So instead, we've decided to add fuel to the fire with the third installment of our OS death match, this time pitting Mac OS X against Windows 2000 . This highly unscientific battle royale compares the two heavyweight contenders from each camp to see who gets to wear the crown. Tell us what you think at software-mailbag@cnet.com . We've braced ourselves for the onslaught.       This Week's Top 10   Top 10 celebrity viruses       [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]   Software [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  Net payment nightmares  It may be convenient to pay for goods digitally, but that path is fraught with danger. Your money may get lost in the ether, you might get locked out of your account, or you may end up paying for goods you never receive. Read on for five frightening tales of transaction terrors, plus tips on how to avoid or fix them. In Software     Electronics [IMAGE] Get the PDA that's right for you  There are as many ways to use handhelds as there are hands to be held. But to make things a little easier, we've narrowed down the field a bit to students, executives, gamers, musicians, and a few other categories. If you're looking for some advice on which PDA is just right for you, click the link above. In Electronics   Wireless [IMAGE] Ask the cell phone diva  We were so impressed by the response to our Wireless Insider "What people are asking the cell phone diva" story that we decided to make it a regular feature on CNET Wireless. Senior Editor Joni Blecher will do her best to track down the answers to all your questions about cell phones, service providers, and accessories. So keep 'em coming! In Wireless    Software [IMAGE] OS death match: OS X vs. Windows 2000  OS X versus Windows 2000, eh? Sure, why not? Both of these operating systems are workstation ready, server friendly, and easy enough for even the smallest home office. So how does plain-Jane Windows 2000 match up with OS X's bells and whistles? We tossed these two operating systems into the arena in a heavyweight matchup, and only we can pick a winner. In Software    Hardware [IMAGE] For richer or for poorer: WinBook X1, J1  How different can two 1GHz notebooks from the same company be? Quite a bit, actually. We pit the sleek WinBook X1 against the bargain WinBook J1 to see which is the better deal. In Hardware    Web Building [IMAGE] Tricks of the trade  As dot-coms fold and thousands of Web workers get pink-slipped, adult Web sites remain a reliable and profitable online venture. Learn how the technologies that are commonly used to put adult content on the Web can be used on any site to successful ends. In Web Building          celebrity viruses [IMAGE] Top Ten  [IMAGE]   [IMAGE] The Chernobyl virus is back, this time lurking  in messages that promise naked pictures of actress/singer Jennifer Lopez. The e-mail tempts credulous users with the subject line "Where are you," and an attachment (jenniferlopez_naked.jpg.vbs) that, when opened, can delete files and make hash of your hard drive. Fortunately, few people have fallen for the Lopez virus. But in light of this latest attack, coupled with February's Anna Kournikova worm , we here at CNET are worried about future celebrity-based viruses. Here are 10 nasties we hope never make it to your in-box:    10 The Madonna virus This unstoppable pathogen defies antivirus programs by constantly reinventing itself. 9 The Jim Jeffords virus Partitions your hard drive so that the two sides don't want to work together. 8 The Michael Jackson virus Launch this bad boy and your entire screen slowly fades to white. 7 The Anne Heche virus Changes all your system settings...then switches them back to the original defaults. 6 The Ozzy Osborne virus Bites the heads off BAT files. 5 The Calista Flockhart virus Claims to eat up your RAM, but we've never noticed any significant impact. 4 The Dan Quayle virus When you run spell-check, this macro virus randomly adds the letter e to the ends of words. 3 The Marcel Marceau virus Deletes all your MP3 and WAV files. 2 The Oprah Winfrey virus Resets your Amazon.com cookies so that you have nothing but Oprah's Book Club titles on your wish list. 1 The Claus Von Bulow virus Rumors that it puts your PC into permanent sleep mode are patently false.

[IMAGE]	[IMAGE] 	[IMAGE]	 [IMAGE]   May 31, 2001   [IMAGE]  --Steve Fox, editor in chief, CNET Networks     Dear readers, If you have a handheld--or are thinking of buying one--maybe it's time to ditch your Walkman. Because listening to music on a handheld device (except a Palm) has finally become practical . What's the problem with Palm? For some inexplicable reason, the world's most popular handheld has no stereo headphone jack. But for most other devices, digital music is a natural. Virtually anything you might want to hear is available in MP3 format, and one broadcaster has even started a wireless digital-music delivery system (something like radio for handhelds). So grab your handheld and tune in. Sounds like a great formula for a harmonious year.       This Week's Top 10   Problems with the new McDonald's wand       [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]   Software [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  Banking on the Net  Does anything call up images of bricks and mortar more than banks do? You'd think these traditional temples would be the last things to go high tech, but online banks are springing up left and right. Can they manage your money as well as your local teller can? CNET's secret shopper opened checking accounts at three online banks and compared the results. See which bank, if any, takes the golden coin. In Software     Electronics [IMAGE] Music on your handheld  Why buy a separate MP3 player when you already carry around a PDA with the processing power to handle digital audio? Learn the best ways to listen to music--and to make your own--on your Palm OS and Pocket PC handheld. In Electronics   Wireless [IMAGE] The ultimate guide to wireless e-mail devices  In the first two parts of our three-part series, we told you about options for Palm OS and Pocket PC devices. Now, in the third and final part, we round up the most popular two-way pagers for wireless e-mail. In Wireless    Software [IMAGE] Office XP superguide  At long last, Office XP hits the shelves this week. What's new and improved? Is your PC up to the challenge? Should you bother to upgrade? Here's everything you need to know about the world's most popular office suite. In Software    Hardware [IMAGE] Apple iBook: snow-white and skinny  The snow-white, slim, crisp-looking iBook takes obvious cues from its much-lauded big brother, the PowerBook G4. Has this little brother behaved? Check our first take. In Hardware    Web Building [IMAGE] Steal this Flash  You don't have to reinvent the wheel to have fun with Flash. We lead you through the ethics, challenges, and practical considerations of customizing open source ActionScript as you build your own version of Pac-Man by altering our media files. In Web Building          problems with the new McDonald's payment system [IMAGE] Top Ten  [IMAGE]   [IMAGE] McDonald's is experimenting with a high-tech payment system: a plastic wand that patrons wave in front of an electronic sensor to pay for burgers and such. Currently being tested in Boise, Idaho, the system  deducts the appropriate charge from a customer's debit or credit card. We don't know if McWands will ever catch on, but we urge Ronald and friends to think carefully before charging ahead. New technologies often yield unintended consequences; witness the following:    10 Open sesame bun Avid Harry Potter fans keep waving wands over their burgers, incanting Latinate phrases such as "Super-sizius." 9 Your money or your burger Get mugged by the Hamburglar and find that your credit card has been debited for 500 Happy Meals. 8 Is that a wand in your pocket... Rash of employee firings stemming from inappropriate wand jokes. 7 No, not the "1812 Overture"! Prankster symphony conductors repeatedly crash the system. 6 Fuzzy magic Income tax equations thrown into disarray when federal government opts for construction of 200-ton wand to wave at national debt. 5 Drive-by wanding You're inadvertently charged for an order of Chicken McNuggets every time you pass a set of golden arches. 4 McDungeons and Dragons Role-playing gamers flock to the new system, only to cancel service when they discover the wands don't shoot fireballs. 3 Burned again Vigorous wand waving could overturn hot cups of coffee, resulting in immediate lawsuits. 2 Would you like spam with that? Wand transmits your demographic info to marketers, who bombard you with Clearasil and ThighMaster ads. 1 Over 10 billion slaughtered Militant vegetarian hackers reconfigure wand to automatically tabulate cow body count with every purchase.

Tiffany walkers?

Recently, in New York, I visited Scott Galloway, the CEO of
Brand Farm, an incubator specializing in e-commerce. Scott
told me his company was "an incubator before incubators were
cool."

"Incubators were never cool," I said, and he admitted that,
yes, being a retail incubator today is like being a short,
slow basketball player: hard to love. Then he went on to
tell me his business was different. He builds operations
around high-margin categories, doesn't limit sales to
online, and offers what he calls "edited selection."

Scott previously launched Red Envelope, a smallish catalog
and site with, to my eyes, wildly overpriced gifts. You pay
for the selection, the packaging, the brand, and the
marketing. It is essentially the Tiffany model.

At Brand Farm, he's developing Gold Violin, a specialty
catalog of luxury gifts for seniors, clearly targeted at
their newly affluent children and grandchildren. Scott is
also working on Room 12, a high-end travel site.

We may snicker at the too-precious products in these
catalogs, but the concept of offering a small number of
compact, beautifully wrapped gifts via multiple channels
sure beats pushing heavy, low-margin bags of dog food on the
Web.

Incubators are not cool. But margins are.

Let me know your preference. Will you coordinate with Lari?

Cat's Workout Program

Cat fitness really can be fun. However, it is important to start any
fitness program only when you feel like it. Don't let a few extra pounds
intimidate you into becoming more active. The most important aspect of
fitness is: when to start the program. The best time is at about 2 a.m. The
house is quiet; there are no distractions. The warm-up is critical. Cats
are experts at stretching, so this won't be a problem. Start with a few
wind sprints, full speed, toenails clicking on the tile or linoleum floors.
A few low but loud growls will help you feel charged up.

Now it is time to add some eye-paw coordination work. Find a marble (the
big steelies work even better) and roll that down the floor as the sprints
continue. See how many times you can ricochet it off the wallboards before
it disappears under the fridge. Finally, work on that upper body strength.
Climbing is a great exercise. Use draperies, macram? plant hangers, or
clothing on hangers. You can even find some carpeting on some basement
walls. Backs of chairs work well, too.

Now put it all together. A speed sprint to the end of the hall! A race
around the living room! Leap to the back of the rocking chair! Let the
rebound launch you to the top of the swinging planter! Rock that baby! Feel
those muscles work. Just as the hook pulls loose from the ceiling, dash to
the bedroom and dive under the covers. Establish your alibi just in time to
hear the crash of the plant to the floor below.

Have a good Work-Out!

Subject: THURS. NITE OUT!!




Daybreak.  Pre-dawn. When the coolness of the night is already beginning to 
give
way to the heat of the day to come.  Air so wet in this godforsaken coastal
delta that you drink it.  Water has to be chewed.

The first sounds registered in the haze covered brain are of the myriad of
creatures that begin stirring as if to trumpet the inevitable sunrise
forthcoming.

We have wandered off course.  Lieutenant Bigfoot has bugged out for some rest
and recycling on foreign soil.  I have been AWOL for so many missions lately I
have serious doubts about whether I can lead this rag tag group of marauders.

What the hell, nothing ventured, nothing gained.  What we need is a mercy
mission.  A landing zone that would appreciate being taken by storm.  A target
that would welcome a large and unexpected crowd.  Someplace untainted, clean,
virgin in its purity.  OK, how about just reasonably clean.

So there it is.

TARGET:        LAST CALL SPORTS BAR AND GRILL

COORDINATES:   WEBSTER STREET BETWEEN SMITH AND LOUISIANA
               (MIDTOWN, WEBSTER IS PARALLEL TO GRAY, ONE BLOCK CLOSER TO THE
MED CENTER               FROM DOWNTOWN)

WHEN:               THURS EVENING AFTER WORK @ 6:30 OR SO (UNLESS YOU ARE A 
REAL
PRO AND                  START AT LUNCH)

WHY:           BECAUSE OTHERWISE LIEUTENANT BIGFOOT WILL THINK HE IS
INDISPENSABLE!

That is all.

DF
